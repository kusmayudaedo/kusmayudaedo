 <summary><h3>:chart_with_upwards_trend: My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
It began in 2021 when the pandemic hit and proved that work from anywhere is possible to do. Unfortunately, as a network engineer, the opportunity to work from anywhere is more limited due to the nature of our role, which involves being in direct contact with networking hardware and the need to be readily available in case of emergencies. After conducting extensive research into remote job opportunities, I have come to the conclusion that pursuing a career in web development aligns best with my interests, goals, and educational background as well.
  
  
  I started by learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, acquiring the foundational knowledge necessary to build websites. Eager to expand my skill set, I ventured into the realm of front-end frameworks and began learning React. With React, I discovered the power of component-based development, enabling me to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
  
  As my curiosity grew, I delved into the world of APIs and back-end development. I learned how to fetch data from external sources and incorporate it into my applications, creating more robust and versatile projects. This motivated me to further my knowledge of back-end technologies.

I embarked on learning Node.js and Express.js, honing my skills in server-side development. I became adept at building APIs, handling data, and managing server requests. This newfound understanding allowed me to create full-stack applications that seamlessly integrated the front-end and back-end.

During my journey, I decided to showcase my progress and skills by developing my first web project, Kerja-id, which now serves as my portfolio. This project allowed me to combine my knowledge and creativity while also demonstrating my ability to bring ideas to life.

Driven by a passion for continuous learning, growth, and coding, I continue to explore new technologies and stay up-to-date with industry trends. My dedication is fueled by the anticipation of landing my first job as a web developer. I am excited to contribute my skills, collaborate with like-minded professionals, and embark on challenging and rewarding projects.
